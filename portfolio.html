            <h3>FizzBuzzBaz</h3>
            <p>
                Let's get the simplest one out of the way first. This is a simple Fizz Buzz program that takes in a list of numbers (in this case the main program is hard coded for 1-105) and will output either Fizz if divisible by 3, Buzz if divisible by 5, Baz if divisible by 7, a combination of the previous three if divisible by a combination of them or just the number. A simple twist on the typical FizzBuzz interview question.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally there is some simple xunit testing that was included to ensure the program executed as expected.

            <h3>Asteroids Clone</h3>
            <p>
                With this, I made a large playing field instead of a simple screen wrap mechanic. Written in JavaScript using the p5.js library. The program keeps track of a large number of different objects and their various movements with minimal noticeable lag.
